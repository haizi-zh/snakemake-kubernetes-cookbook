# Introduction

Snakemake is a great workflow management tool, especially when combined with Kubernetes, it enables you access to enormous computing power and very robust workflow management.

This document is NOT a detailed guide to either snakemake or Kubernetes. It is just a cookbook for common scenarios when using snakemake and Kubernetes together.. You can always refer to their official documentation sites for more information:

* Snakemake: [https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Kubernetes: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)

This document contains several sections:

* Snakemake: brief introduction to snakemake and recipes for common scenarios
* Kubernetes/EKS: basics about Kubernetes and a brief introduction to AWS EKS
* Combined Together: how to run snakemake jobs on a Kubernetes backend
